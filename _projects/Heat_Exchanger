 This project analyzes the performance of a liquid–liquid plate heat exchanger by examining how thermal energy is transferred between a hot water loop and a cold water loop under different operating configurations. Using experimental temperature measurements from both counterflow and parallel flow, the system is modeled using thermodynamic control-volume analysis to evaluate heat transfer behavior, efficiency, and expected performance changes.
