description: Desing a lifting mechanism to life max possible weight to highest possible height.

As part of a class project I designed a 2D lifting mechanism within a 150 cm by 50 cm space. The goal was to create a setup that could lift the greatest possible weight to the highest point using a rigid bar, three pin supports, and a linear actuator. I experimented with different configurations and used equilibrium equations to determine the most effective placement for the actuator and supports. This project helped me strengthen my understanding of force balance, geometry, and structural efficiency while applying core statics principles to a practical design problem.
