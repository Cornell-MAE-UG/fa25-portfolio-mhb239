 Mamadou is pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering at Cornell University, with a focus on developing technical and soft skill expertise. His coursework so far has provided him with a strong foundation in Physics, computing,  and advanced mathematics which have strengthened both his problem-solving skills and curiosity towards Applications of Engineering in real world challenges.

At Cornell’s Engineering Summer Math Research Institute (ESMI), He contributed to a project on autonomous vehicle bottleneck flow, where He and his peers developed both stochastic and deterministic models to analyze traffic patterns. This work allowed him to apply theoretical concepts to practical scenarios, improve his programming skills in Python, and present data-driven insights on traffic efficiency to a broader audience.

Previously he interned at the NYC Department of Youth & Community Development (DYCD). In this role, he organized youth summits, partnered with organizations to strengthen civic involvement, and helped support underserved neighborhoods. This opportunity provided him with experience and skills in leadership,  communication, collaboration, social responsibility and community engagement.

His interest lies in the energy sector of Mechanical Engineering, Mainly in the design and building of eco-friendly energy systems. He hopes to bring  a collaborative and environmental responsibility perspective in engineering challenges while leveraging his strong background in technical and soft skills.
